## Firebase Configuration

Ensure you have a Firebase project set up. If you accidentally upload your `firebaseInit.js` file, follow these steps:
1. Add `firebaseInit.js` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being tracked:
   ```
   # Ignore Firebase configuration
   src/firebaseInit.js
   ```
2. If already pushed to GitHub, run:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached src/firebaseInit.js
   git commit -m "Remove firebaseInit from tracking"
   git push origin main
   ```
